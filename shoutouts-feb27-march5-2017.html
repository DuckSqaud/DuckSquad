<p> Description: Ah, the GameCube controller is a beautiful thing, so I wanted to recreate it in Scratch! The music is a random cycle of music from GameCube games </p>

<p> Menu: To order something, wait until you can type in your order, and then type in the number corresponding with the item you want in the menu.

Item Descriptions:

Iced Coffee (#1): This one hasn't really changed at all. Most people in the future prefer their coffee cold instead of hot.

Banana Frappuccino (#2): This is the most popular drink at Scratch Coffee! It is usually eaten with a slice of Banana Cream Pie.

Raspberry Iced Tea (#3): This is a sweet tea that lots of people enjoy in the morning, for breakfast.

Apple Lemonade (#4): This drink is the perfect combination of sweet and sour. Enjoy it on the go or right here in the comfort of Scratch Coffee

Bacon Soda (#5): Do you like bacon? How about soda? If you said yes to either of those questions, this savory drink is for you!

Sea Soup (#6): If you admire either the sea or @Csoup's projects, I'd recommend you try this delicious soup, topped with fresh sea salt and seaweed.

Grass Muffin (#7): This muffin is most popular in the beginning of the year, as it is a treat fresh out of the oven to help you warm up in the frigid outdoors. Oh and also People make new year's resolutions to eat healthier, and I guess this looks healthy to them.

Charcoal Donut (#8): A glazed donut topped with some charcoal powder. Honestly, you'll barely be able to tell the difference between that and powdered sugar!

Banana Cream Pie (#9): A slice of pie fresh from the oven, best enjoyed with a cold Banana Frappuccino.

Gloop and Schlopp (#10) A cold, refreshing bowl of soup perfect for if you're in a hurry. In my opinion, it is best when topped with cucumber. </p>
