<h1>About Us<h1>
<p> Great ways to play Gran Turismo 5 (in my opionion.) By: Cooper.</P>
<p> BUY A RACING WHEEL! I use a Trust Gaming GTX, (I'm not sure the exact wheel.) </p>
<p> Before you buy it, it's not that great! I suggest a Logitech wheel. </p>
<p> The only thing I like about it is that it's cheap, comes with a shifter built-in, I don't like that it's a PADDLE SHIFTER, but it's a short throw shifter. I do like those, (not paddle-shifters.) </p>
